# Approach

    ### Create a main home page
    ### Create a component for hotel list (HotelList)
    ### Create a component for each hotel card (HotelDetails)
    ### Create a redux store to make an API call to get the list of hotels
    ### For now I have added the data.json and fetching it from there using an axios call
    ### On application load the getHotelsList API call is made and the Hotel list is populated
    ### The list can be sorted by price low to high or vice versa
    ### I was not able to cover test cases in 4 hours.
